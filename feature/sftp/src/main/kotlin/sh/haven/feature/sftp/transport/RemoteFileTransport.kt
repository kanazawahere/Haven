/**
 * Abstraction over the SSH-backed file operations the SFTP screen needs —
 * the richer cousin of [FileBackend] for transports that can do more than
 * list. Two implementations live alongside this interface:
 *  - [SftpTransport] — wraps JSch's ChannelSftp (the historical happy path)
 *  - [ScpTransport]  — speaks legacy SCP (scp -t / -f) over an exec channel
 *                       plus `ls -la` for directory listings
 *
 * The rclone / SMB / local backends share the whole [FileBackend] surface
 * with this interface; only streaming upload / download with progress
 * reporting and the POSIX-only chmod / chown still need this richer type
 * (issue #126).
