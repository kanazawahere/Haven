 * Backend-agnostic file operations. Implementations exist for every browser

 * the local Android filesystem, SMB shares, rclone-managed cloud remotes,
 * and Reticulum listeners.
 *
 * This is the control-plane surface for the file browser (issue #126):
 * listing, structural ops (delete / mkdir / rename), small-file IO
 * ([readBytes] / [writeBytes]), [stat], [openInputStream], and the
 * copy/paste orchestration (tree walk, conflict probe, parent mkdir-p)
 * all dispatch through it. Only streaming transfers with progress
 * reporting and the POSIX-only chmod / chown remain on
 * [RemoteFileTransport].
