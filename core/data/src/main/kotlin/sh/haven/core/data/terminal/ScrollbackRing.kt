/**
 * Fixed-capacity byte ring used as the agent transport's per-session
 * mirror of recent SSH stdout. Once full, every new byte evicts the
 * oldest one. Concurrent appends from the SSH reader thread are
 * serialised against [snapshot] reads via a single intrinsic lock — the
 * volume here is per-session terminal output, not a hot path, so the
 * lock cost is unmeasurable next to the SSH I/O it gates.
 *
 * Bytes are stored verbatim: ANSI escape sequences, OSC markers, and
 * other control bytes flow through unchanged so the agent (or a tool
 * that strips ANSI) can decide what to do with them.
